Description: HTTPS for money.
 Based on Bitcoin's code, it intends to offer a far higher standard
 of privacy and anonymity through a sophisticated zero-knowledge
 proving scheme which preserves confidentiality of transaction metadata.
 This package provides the daemon, zcashd/zcld, and the CLI tool,
 zcash-cli/zcl-cli, to interact with the daemon.
